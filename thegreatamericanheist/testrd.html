            <p class="center-block"><strong>1971</strong> - My mom called me into a room with my four older siblings crying and asked me to pick who I wanted to live with. My dad was moving out. So, from nine to eighteen (when I joined the Army), I got moved around 19 times. Getting shuffled from one family member to the next, I learned what powered milk, meat out of a can, and government cheese was. The lack of money puts intense stress on a family, and I wanted to fix mine, but I was helpless. As I grew up and became a man, I always had a heart for those less fortunate and developed a real passion for those being taken advantage of. I know money is one of the top reasons for divorce, so when I can save a company money, I believe I could be saving a job and a family. </p>

            <p class="center-block"><strong>2002</strong> - While I was still working on the other side of the aisle, I was flying back home after speaking at a conference in LA. I happened to be seated next to a movie producer. She had just finished the movie <span class="italic" style="display: contents;">The Last Samurai</span>, starring Tom Cruise. After sharing her exciting profession, she asked me what I did; needless to say, I felt like I had nothing to share. What I do is boring, or so I thought. After telling her about the lack of regulation and the rampant over-billing and deception, to my surprise, she told me she thought this would make a great, high-suspense movie! “Not likely,” I laughed. But it planted a seed… not just about this book, but the question, “Could I make a difference in this world?”  </p>

            <p class="center-block"><strong>2011</strong> -  I went on the Michale Gerber Show promoting this book in its first form but decided not to release it. I thought there were too many changes each year in the credit card processing industry ever to make a book that would be current. Credit card processors are constantly changing how they overbill merchants. Also, the firm was growing way too fast and took up entirely too much of my time to take on this mammoth project.  </p>

            <p class="center-block"><strong>2013</strong> - I got an opportunity to co-author a book with Steve Forbes and other up-and-coming entrepreneurs. I talked about how many businesses fail because they spend so much time perfecting what they do that they fail to see the competition is creating a whole different product, just like the 8 track to the cassette, then the CD to the jump drive, to the iPod to streaming. In order to survive, you have to keep recreating yourself to meet the demand, and if you have the attitude, “We have always done it this way,” well, that’s the beginning of the end. </p>

              <p><strong>2022</strong> - I got a call from an Amazon representative who, after seeing my first co-authored book, asked if I would be willing to write a book on my own. This would be about telling my story, as well as exposing the corruptive billing practices credit card processors use. After thinking about it for a few months, I decided that as I get closer to retirement, now is the time. If not now, it may never get written. If not me, then who will ever expose them? </p>

              <p><strong>2023</strong> - It’s finally done. WOW! And while the book is not as massive as many other business books out there, it only took over six weeks to write and over a year to get all the details finalized. I feel good knowing that I walked away from the corruption and have made a difference. Millions of merchants are overbilled each year, and millions of businesses will most likely never read this book. But, like the old Starfish story, even if most businesses never read this book, it will absolutely matter to the ones that do. My firm saves businesses hundreds of millions of dollars per year, but that is a small dent to the 200 billion dollars that we estimate businesses are being overbilled each and every year. Truly, the most gratifying thing for me is that I think my late mother would be proud of the man I have become. </p> </div>

He’s recently been mentoring me and had some really good things to say about weAudit.com. So, with the book being sold out, I asked the publisher to hold the presses before printing any more so that we could add his thoughts. I’m stoked to have such a business icon pour into me. What are the odds of getting to work with Steve Forbes and one of the original sharks on <span class="italic" style="display: contents;">Shark Tank</span>? I cannot wait to see what comes next!...</p>
